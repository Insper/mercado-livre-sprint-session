  abstract = "Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is a predictive
              biomarker for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 inhibitor (PARPi)
              sensitivity. Routine HRD testing relies on identifying BRCA
              mutations, but additional HRD-positive patients can be identified
              by measuring genomic instability (GI), a consequence of HRD.
              However, the cost and complexity of available solutions hamper GI
              testing. We introduce a deep learning framework, GIInger, that
              identifies GI from HRD-induced scarring observed in low-pass
              whole-genome sequencing data. GIInger seamlessly integrates into
              standard BRCA testing workflows and yields reproducible results
              concordant with a reference method in a multisite study of 327
              ovarian cancer samples. Applied to a BRCA wild-type enriched
              subgroup of 195 PAOLA-1 clinical trial patients, GIInger
              identified HRD-positive patients who experienced significantly
              extended progression-free survival when treated with PARPi.
              GIInger is, therefore, a cost-effective and easy-to-implement
              method for accurately stratifying patients with ovarian cancer
              for first-line PARPi treatment.",
